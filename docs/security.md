# Security (Taint) Checks

### What it detects

| Vulnerability   | OWASP    | Examples                                                      |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Injection   | A03:2021 | `DB::statement()`, `DB::unprepared()`, raw query methods      |
| Shell Injection | A03:2021 | `Process::run()`, `Process::command()`                        |
| XSS             | A03:2021 | `Response::make()` with unescaped content                     |
| SSRF            | A10:2021 | `Http::get()`, `Http::post()` with user-controlled URLs       |
| File Traversal  | A01:2021 | `Storage::get()`, `File::delete()` with user-controlled paths |
| Open Redirect   | A01:2021 | `redirect()`, `Redirect::to()` with user-controlled URLs      |
| Crypto misuse   | A02:2021 | Tracks encryption/hashing taint escape and unescape           |
| Timing attack   | A02:2021 | Secret compared with `===`, `<=>`, `strcmp()` (CWE-208)       |

`UploadedFile::getClientOriginalExtension()` is deliberately not a `file` source:
Symfony's `File::getName()` and `UploadedFile::getClientOriginalExtension()` yield a
slash-, backslash-, and dot-free extension, which cannot form a traversal segment.

`UploadedFile::clientExtension()` is deliberately not a taint source. The client
chooses the MIME lookup key, but Symfony returns a value from the application's
configured MIME registry. This avoids false positives for generated upload
filenames; applications that populate that registry from untrusted data must model
that boundary separately.

Security scanning runs automatically alongside type analysis, no extra configuration needed.

### `ResponseFactory::make()` HTML responses

`ResponseFactory::make()` reports XSS for unescaped content because its default
response is HTML. The finding is dropped only for a positional call whose
headers array is written literally at the call site and contains one direct
string `Content-Disposition: attachment` entry. It is dropped as it is reported,
so no other flow through the same code is affected.

The gate is deliberately syntactic. Every header entry must be a literal string
key and a literal string value. A variable holding the very same attachment
array keeps the finding, which makes it the most likely false positive to meet
in real code. Dynamic, duplicate, list valued, underscore named, or non
attachment dispositions continue to report, as do all content type only
responses and every named argument call. This applies to the concrete factory,
its contract, and the `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response` facade, including a
receiver whose type intersects one of them with another interface. The root
`\Response` alias and custom classes with a `make()` method keep the sink. A
receiver typed as the factory or its contract is trusted to apply the headers
argument, as every conforming implementation does. An implementation that
silently discards its headers argument violates that contract and is out of
scope.

### Known limitation: named arguments

Psalm keys a named argument's taint node by the argument's written position rather than by the
parameter it names ([vimeo/psalm#11923](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/11923)), so taint
can be reported against the wrong parameter. Until that is fixed upstream, the plugin drops
taint from a named argument it cannot prove is attributed correctly.

Detection is unaffected when the callee is statically known (a plain function, a facade, a
static call, a constructor, or a method on a receiver typed as exactly one class) and the
argument names the parameter at its own position, which covers ordinary application code. It is
lost for a dynamic callee, a receiver Psalm cannot resolve to a single class (including a
chained call such as `Storage::disk('local')->put(path: $input)`, where the receiver is an
expression rather than a variable), an argument captured by a variadic, and a `static::` call
resolved through a subclass override. Passing the same values positionally always reports.

### Timing-unsafe secret comparison (CWE-208)

Comparing a secret (a password hash, remember-token, or decrypted value) with a
variable-time operator leaks it byte-by-byte to an attacker who can measure
response time. The plugin flags secret-tainted values that flow into `===`, `==`,
`!==`, `!=`, `<=>`, or the `strcmp()` / `strcasecmp()` / `strncmp()` /
`strncasecmp()` / `substr_compare()` family. Use `hash_equals()` for a
constant-time comparison instead.

```php
$user->getAuthPassword() === $given;            // flagged
hash_equals($user->getAuthPassword(), $given);  // safe
```

Comparisons against a literal (`$token === null`, `$key === ''`) are not flagged:
the literal is the known half, so nothing about the secret leaks.

The finding is reported as `TaintedUserSecret` or `TaintedSystemSecret`, and the
flagged location is the comparison itself. The message text is the generic
`Detected tainted user secret leaking` rather than a CWE-208-specific one, because
Psalm hardcodes taint messages per kind ([vimeo/psalm#11762](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/11762)).
Treat any such finding from this plugin as a timing issue and fix it with
`hash_equals()`.
