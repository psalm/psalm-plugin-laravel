# Security (Taint) Checks

### What it detects

| Vulnerability   | OWASP    | Examples                                                      |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Injection   | A03:2021 | `DB::statement()`, `DB::unprepared()`, raw query methods      |
| Shell Injection | A03:2021 | `Process::run()`, `Process::command()`                        |
| XSS             | A03:2021 | `Response::make()` with unescaped content                     |
| SSRF            | A10:2021 | `Http::get()`, `Http::post()` with user-controlled URLs       |
| File Traversal  | A01:2021 | `Storage::get()`, `File::delete()` with user-controlled paths |
| Open Redirect   | A01:2021 | `redirect()`, `Redirect::to()` with user-controlled URLs      |
| Crypto misuse   | A02:2021 | Tracks encryption/hashing taint escape and unescape           |
| Timing attack   | A02:2021 | Secret compared with `===`, `<=>`, `strcmp()` (CWE-208)       |

Security scanning runs automatically alongside type analysis, no extra configuration needed.

### Timing-unsafe secret comparison (CWE-208)

Comparing a secret (a password hash, remember-token, or decrypted value) with a
variable-time operator leaks it byte-by-byte to an attacker who can measure
response time. The plugin flags secret-tainted values that flow into `===`, `==`,
`!==`, `!=`, `<=>`, or the `strcmp()` / `strcasecmp()` / `strncmp()` /
`strncasecmp()` / `substr_compare()` family. Use `hash_equals()` for a
constant-time comparison instead.

```php
$user->getAuthPassword() === $given;            // flagged
hash_equals($user->getAuthPassword(), $given);  // safe
```

Comparisons against a literal (`$token === null`, `$key === ''`) are not flagged:
the literal is the known half, so nothing about the secret leaks.

The finding is reported as `TaintedUserSecret` or `TaintedSystemSecret`, and the
flagged location is the comparison itself. The message text is the generic
`Detected tainted user secret leaking` rather than a CWE-208-specific one, because
Psalm hardcodes taint messages per kind ([vimeo/psalm#11762](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/11762)).
Treat any such finding from this plugin as a timing issue and fix it with
`hash_equals()`.
